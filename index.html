                <p>Hello!  I'm Jeff!  I have always been an artistic individual with a wicked sense of humor. A lot of my time during childhood was spent drawing. Everyone that knew me assumed that I would end up doing some type of art as an adult. And while my secondary education started off that way (pursuing Commercial Art at the local community college), life happened, and I got sidetracked.</p>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="col-12">
                <p>My professional career up to this point has been within the financial services industry, but I began to get that creative itch again starting with roles like business analyst, product development manager, and project manager. I realized that I was feeling fulfilled in that creative realm again, even if it was just through research, writing business requirements and developing test plans.</p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <p>A few years ago I was fortunate enough to enroll in a program called Interactive Media and Web Design at the Art Institute of Colorado, where I was able to start exploring design for a second time, but now from a digital perspective. After a few semesters of work with Photoshop, Illustrator, and After Effects, I started a new position as a Content Manager (with a later promotion to Web Developer I) that had me coding professionally for the first time. In this role I was responsible for coding emails using HTML & CSS, and making minor content updates to product-related web-pages. The coding bug bit me, and I needed to scratch it.</p>

            <div class="col-12">
                <p>Fast forward a few years, and the company I worked for decided to pull out of the Denver area, and I had no interest in moving, either back to their home office in Lansing, MI (where I grew up), or to their other large office in the Nashville, TN area. I decided that it was time for me to invest some capital of my own into the next more creative part of my career, and enrolled in the Full Stack Flex Web Development Bootcamp at the University of Denver in October of 2018.</p>

                <p>The Bootcamp I'm attending will wrap up in February of 2019, and I'm hoping that with my broad experience with product development, project management, as well as my newer experience with coding, that I can find a Junior Web Developer position locally where I can continue to learn and grow into a full-fledged Web Developer!</p>
